# Kessler Syndrome

This is our entry into the 2025 GMTK Game Jam. The theme for 2025 was "Loop"
so we interpreted it as an object moving around in a circle - an orbit.
Therefore, we made a game in which you play as a satellite orbiting a planet
and you have fight other alien satellites/probes. If you think about it, orbits
are just giant loops in space.

Enjoy!
